# README Formatting Preferences

When creating or editing README.md files, follow these formatting guidelines:

## Section Headers
- All section headers must include relevant emojis that match the section content
- Use appropriate heading levels (# for main title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)

## Tone and Style
- Maintain a friendly and concise tone throughout
- Be welcoming and approachable
- Keep explanations clear and to the point
- Avoid overly technical jargon unless necessary

## Lists and Organization
- Use bullet lists for features, requirements, and setup steps
- Prefer `-` for unordered lists
- Use numbered lists only for sequential steps
- Keep list items concise (1-2 lines maximum)

## Code Blocks
- Include at least one code block per README
- Use appropriate language tags for syntax highlighting (```bash, ```python, ```javascript, etc.)
- Provide clear context before each code block
- Include installation commands, usage examples, or configuration snippets

## Required Sections
Every README should include:
- 📋 **Project Title** with emoji

- 💻 **Usage** - with code examples
- 📁 **File References** - list of key files with their paths
- (Optional) 🤝 **Contributing**, 📄 **License**, 📧 **Contact**

## Spacing Guidelines
- Use exactly **one blank line** between sections
- Use exactly **one blank line** before and after code blocks
- No extra blank lines at the end of the file
- Consistent spacing throughout the entire document

## File References Section Format
Always include a "File References" section near the end with this structure:
```
## 📁 File References
