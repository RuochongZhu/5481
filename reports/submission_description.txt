I queried the project's USGS earthquake API, aggregated results into a compact JSON digest, and then used local Ollama to generate a markdown situation report. I iterated from a simple 6-bullet prompt to a fixed-section report prompt to improve structure and actionability, and saved each iteration plus the final report to files for submission screenshots.
